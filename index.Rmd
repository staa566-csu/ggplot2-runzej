  geom_point(size=3,shape=16)
###density plot
ggplot(data = mpg,mapping = aes(hwy))+

###  simple lm smooth
ggplot(data = mpg,mapping = aes(displ,cty))+
  geom_point(color="green",size=2)+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")+
  labs(title="Hwy VS displ")
### facet wrap using

  geom_smooth(color="green",method = "lm") +
  facet_wrap(~drv)+
  labs(title="Hwy VS displ")
           


```

The dataset I select is mpg in R.
drv:type of drive train, f(front) r(rear) 4wd(4)
hwy:highway miles per gallon
cyl:number of cylinders
The first plot I made is the dot plot and the size 3 and shape 16 is more to recognize and make analysis.
One key conclusion from the plot:
  When having the same drv, the more number of cyl, the less hwy car runs.


The second plot I made is about the density plot and the plot shows the density of three types of driving.
The 4wd driving plot looks pretty normal.
